Sorting Suite is an implementation of various sorting algorithms, along with a benchmarking tool to compare them. Algorithms will include bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and (extensions). It allows for both command line usage and importing a file of numbers to be sorted. Duplicate numbers are discarded.

Simplest case: empty array or list ([])
Next complex: A single number ([1], 1)

Edge cases: negative numbers, duplicates, nonintegers, file with unexpected data or chars
