Sorting Suite is an implementation of various sorting algorithms, along with a benchmarking tool to compare them. Algorithms bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and (extensions).

Empty arrays or single numbers should be returned as sorted.


Edge cases: negative numbers, duplicates, nonintegers, file with unexpected data or chars. With my implementation of bubble sort, an array of 2 numbers also represents an edge case, as the check for number of iterations would otherwise discard the array. An array sorted in reverse also represents an edge case as in bubble sort, the smallest number in the last position won't get sorted until the very last pass.
